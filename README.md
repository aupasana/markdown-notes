# markdown-notes

Scripts to assist with taking notes using markdown + yaml

## How to

- Put this in a folder, and place your notes in a relative folder labelled "meetings".
- Run Process.py incrementally as needed
- This outputs
  - Indexes in the meetings_index folder
  - New task items in the tasks folder
  
**Note** This is an early first dirty code script at this time.
